# Themes for Lapis Anki Notes

Simple CSS files containing recolors of the [Lapis Anki Note Type](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis).  Palettes used:

- [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/palette/)
- [RosÃ© Pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/palette/)
- [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
- [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.deviantart.com/cdixon13/art/CyberPunk-2077-Palette-879017278)

The CSS files are named after the palette.  For palettes having a light mode (Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Rose Pine), the light mode is set to the equivalent light mode palette for the theme.  Cyberpunk does not have a light mode.

**Now Updated to Lapis+ Note Type (v1.6.0)**

## Installation

Choose which variant you want and copy all the CSS from the file.  In Anki, go to Manage Note Types -> Cards -> Styling and replace all the CSS there with the CSS from this repo.

Alternatively, in Manage Note Types, hit Add and use Lapis as a base note type. You can clone it multiple times in this way and have access to all recolors you like as separate note types that you can easily switch between.  Changing note type is seamless between the recolors.

The only thing changed is color codes in CSS so as long as the version of these recolors and the version of your Lapis note are the same, nothing will break.

## Notes

I will try to keep these files updated along with the Lapis note type, but please keep in mind updating Lapis without updating these files will likely break your cards.

For issues with these files please contact me (open issue or ping ccos on TMW) rather than the Lapis maintainers.
