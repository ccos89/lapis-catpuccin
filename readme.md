# Catpuccin Recolors for Lapis Anki Notes

Simple CSS files containing recolors of the [Lapis Anki Note Type](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis) from the [Catpuccin](https://catppuccin.com/palette/) palette.

The CSS files are named after the palette, and the light mode on all of them is the Latte palette.

## Installation

Choose which variant you want (from darkest to lightest: mocha, macchiato, frappe) and copy all the CSS from the file.  In Anki, go to Manage Note Types -> Cards -> Styling and replace all the CSS there with the CSS from this repo.

Alternatively, in Manage Note Types, hit Add and use Lapis as a base note type. You can clone it three times in this way and have access to all three recolors as separate note types that you can easily switch between.
